# Postulate-Ideathon-Team-Efficiency
Competition organised by the E-CELL DTU , NAMED IDEATHON Where we as a Team EFFICIENCY become one of the finalists lead by Harsh Jain(@jain346) with my partner Aaryan Arora(aaryan2134). 
## Problem Statement - Environment
Environment plays an important role in healthy living and the existence of life on planet earth. Therefore, it is important to protect and conserve our natural resources including air, water, and forest in order to maintain the overall health of our environment as all these resources are at some risk today.

## The Problem we chose to tackle

It has been widely known that when we idle vehicles during traffic lights, there are significant emissions that harm the environment. It is estimated that 0.01 Litres of Petrol is used for 10 minutes of idling. This amounts to about 30 Million kgs of Carbon Dioxide emissions for a city like Delhi. These emissions lead to air pollution and global warming. We aim to provide a solution that can almost eliminate this excess and in turn help in  conservation of fossil fuels, money and most importantly health of the environment.

## Our Solution

We are focussed to build a hardware product that is accessible to the 2 Wheeler driver and the main idea behind it is to automatically turn off the engine whenever the 2 Wheeler vehicle is in idle condition satisfying any of the above situations. The Idle condition of the vehicle is defined as the static state of a vehicle having zero velocity for a certain period of time ( minimum considering in seconds).And the period of the time will be varying quantity that can be changed by the driver depending upon the situation and also using the real time information provided by Google maps as well as using sensors like accelerometer .
